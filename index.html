        <h3>Welcome to Project IRIS</h3>

<p>Hello There! This is Brian from Singapore Polytechnic.~</p>  
 
<a href="http://s1367.photobucket.com/user/BrianSYC/media/IMG_0372_zps2f8a6770.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r794/BrianSYC/IMG_0372_zps2f8a6770.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo IMG_0372_zps2f8a6770.jpg"/></a>
 
<p>I am responsible for the computer vision modules for the Under Water Robot Project. This repository will contain all my codes to serve as backup as well as a guide for my juniors who will be taking over this project. I am trying my best to ensure that all my codes are heavily commented on to ensure easy understanding. Currently, my codes are written in Python. This is due to the fact that Python is an easy language to pick up as well as the fact that i will be needing this language to program my Raspberry Pi.</p> 
 

<h3>The Under Water Robot Project</h3>

<p>Project IRIS is a subset of the Under Water Robot Project. The main project is to [re]construct an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle(AUV). There are several groups of different disciplines working on this project and i am the leader of one of these groups(EEE). We are mainly in charge of the software aspects of the project.(Keyboard Warriors!) </p> 
 
<p>There are three people, including myself in the EEE group. Each of us have been assigned individual responsibilities as shown below: </p>  
 
<pre><code>Yong Boon ---> Compass & Depth Sensor
Wei Khang ----> Control Systems
Brian -----------> Computer Vision
</code></pre> 

<h3>Getting Down To Business</h3> 
 
<p>Why does the AUV need computer vision? Well without computer vision, the AUV would not be able to track the black line on the floor of the pool, avoid obstacles and detect and knock the flare. We are basically giving our robot vision!</p>

<p>Based on my research for about a month, i have made several discoveries as well as conclusions. Firstly, all the knowledge needed on computer vision to complete this task successfully, is simply scratching the surface of the topic of computer vision. Secondly since our project uses Raspberry Pi/BeagleBone Black, it is vital to know C++,C,Python and Linux commands at your fingertips. Last but not least, do take time to source out suitable components for the project. Not all cameras are compatible with Raspberry Pi/BeagleBoneBlack.</p>
