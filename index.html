        <h3>Welcome to Project IRIS</h3>

<p>Hello There! This is Brian from Singapore Polytechnic.~</p>  
 
<p>I am responsible for the computer vision modules for the Under Water Robot Project. This repository will contain all my codes to serve as backup as well as a guide for my juniors who will be taking over this project. I am trying my best to ensure that all my codes are heavily commented on to ensure easy understanding. Currently, my codes are written in Python. This is due to the fact that Python is an easy language to pick up as well as the fact that i will be needing this language to program my Raspberry Pi.</p> 

<h3>The Under Water Robot Project</h3>

<p>Project IRIS is a subset of the Under Water Robot Project. The main project is to [re]construct an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle(AUV). There are several groups of different disciplines working on this project and i am the leader of one of these groups(EEE). We are mainly in charge of the software aspects of the project.(Keyboard Warriors!) </p> 
 
<p>There are three people, including myself in the EEE group. Each of us have been assigned individual responsibilities as shown below: </p>  
 
<pre><code>Yong Boon ---> Compass & Depth Sensor
Wei Khang ----> Control Systems
Brian -----------> Computer Vision
</code></pre>  
 
<p>One of the AUVs.</p>

<h3>Getting Down To Business</h3> 
 
<p>Why does the AUV need computer vision? Well without computer vision, the AUV would not be able to track the black line on the floor of the pool, avoid obstacles and detect and knock the flare. We are basically giving our robot vision!</p>

<p>Based on my research for about a month, i have made several discoveries as well as conclusions. Firstly, all the knowledge needed on computer vision to complete this task successfully, is simply scratching the surface of the topic of computer vision. Secondly since our project uses Raspberry Pi/BeagleBone Black, it is vital to know C++,C,Python and Linux commands at your fingertips. Last but not least, do take time to source out suitable components for the project. Not all cameras are compatible with Raspberry Pi/BeagleBoneBlack.</p>

<p>Not as easy as you think.</p>

<h3>Pool Day!</h3>

<p>No, no one is swimming. Only the Remotely Operated Vehicle(ROV) is swimming. Our supervisors brought us down to pool to demonstrate the ROV. Everyone from all the groups was present and we sure had fun.</p>

<h3>Becoming a Keyboard Warrior</h3>

<p>Before you start reading this, please ensure that you are at least familiar with Linux commands as well as Python Programming, else you wont fully understand what i will be typing here.</p> 
 
<p>Whether you are using a Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone, the first step that i recommend you do is to familiarize yourself with the board. And so here is a guide on the pure basics of operating your embedded system. </p> 
 
<p>{Starting up the Raspberry Pi}<br>
1.) Connect your Pi to a power outlet.(5V,1A Don't turn it on yet!)<br>
2.) Connect the rest of the necessary peripherals.(E.g. Mouse, Keyboard, Screen) <br>
3.) Power on the Pi and wait for it to prompt you for your login and password.(Default login is pi, Default password is raspberry) <br>
4.) If this is the very first time you are setting up the Pi, type in <code>sudo raspi-config</code> to configure your Pi.(Use the arrow keys to control the UI)<br>
5.) Type in <code>startx</code>. This code is to launch the GUI desktop.($60 mini computer. Cool right?)<br>
6.) You can access the terminal again by double clicking on the LXTerminal icon on the desktop. <br>
7.) Type in <code>sudo shutdown -h now</code> to shutdown your Pi.</p>
