COMPUTER VISION                                           V1.0
============================================================================== 
Introduction: 
Hello There! This is Brian from Singapore Polytechnic.~  
I am responsible for the computer vision modules for the Underwater Robot Project. This repository will contain all my codes to serve as backup as well as a guide for my juniors who will be taking over this project. I am trying my best to ensure that all my codes are heavily commented on to ensure easy understanding. Currently, my codes are written in Python. This is due to the fact that Python is an easy language to pick up as well as the fact that i will be needing this language to program my Raspberry Pi. I have stored tutorials and codes on my repository on GitHub in the link below.(fruitspunchsamurai)

Libraries Installed: 
In order for the codes to run successfully, it is crucial to have the required libraries. Here is a list on the libraries i have imported for the Raspberry Pi. 
 
- RPi.GPIO
- OpenCV V2.3.1 

Using the Codes: 
The majority of my codes are written in Python. However there may be some exceptions. There will be an indicator for you to tell which scripts are written in which language.  
 
pythonv2.7 -------------------------------------------------------> Python IDE Version 2.7 
pythonv3.2 -------------------------------------------------------> Python IDE Version 3.2 
C++ --------------------------------------------------------------> C++ IDE 
 
*All codes are required to be run as a sudo user through the LXTerminal*

Description of Codes:(Pythonv2.7)
