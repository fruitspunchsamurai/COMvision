Singapore Polytechnic [MDP] [AUV] Computer Vision  
 
Hello There! This is Brian from Singapore Polytechnic.~  
I am responsible for the computer vision modules for the Under Water Robot Project. This repository will contain 
all my codes to serve as backup as well as a guide for my juniors who will be taking over this project. I am trying 
my best to ensure that all my codes are heavily commented on to ensure easy understanding. 

Currently, my codes are written in Python. This is due to the fact that Python is an easy language to pick up as well 
as the fact that I will be needing this language to program my Raspberry Pi.
